🎵 AUDIO FILES NEEDED 🎵

To enable audio in your BlockDrop game, add these two files to this folder:

1. music.mp3 - Background music for the game
2. clear.mp3 - Sound effect when clearing lines

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use royalty-free music only!
Do NOT use copyrighted music like the original Tetris theme.

📖 See AUDIO_SETUP.md for:
- Where to download free music
- Recommended audio sources
- License information
- Setup instructions

The game will work without audio files, but you won't hear any sound.
